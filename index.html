				Hello, my name is Austin Van Bockern and welcome to my website. I was live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota where I was born and raised. I am a second year 
				Computer Programming student at Southeast Technical Institute which is also located in Sioux Falls. I took a computer programming course in high school 
				and I found programming very intriguing. I decided I would like to pursue a career in computer programming and starting search for schools that offered 
				degrees in that field. Though there were a few different options when deciding where to pursue my degree, I chose Southeast Tech because I felt a 
				drawing to a technical college and it was also conveniently located in my hometown.
			</p>
			<p>
				During my time attending Southeast Technical Institute, Iâ€™ve learned a variety of languages including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, C#, SQL, and 
				XML. The language I am most proficient in is C#; not only because I find C# to be one the most flexible and user-friendly languages, but also because 
				most of the independent programming I do is in C#. I have designed programs to recognize and accept input from external devices; the output from each 
				button on that device would be determined by the user.
