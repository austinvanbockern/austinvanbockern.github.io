		<h3>Javamon</h3>
		<p>
		For a school project, my classmate, Ethan Parlet, and I decided to make a in-browser video game. We wanted this game would resemble the old-school Red and Blue Pokemon gameboy games. 
		We also wanted to make it humorous and personal. There are a lot of jokes and funny lines in the game that made presenting it to the class very fun. All of the code and art was made entirely from scratch. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code our game.
		</p>

		<p>
		Overall, making this game was a great experience. Even though we would make our next game very differently if we did a project like this again, it was still very
		benefitial to us as developers.
